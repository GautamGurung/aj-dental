        <h2>Family Review</h2>
        <p>This has got to be the best dentist my kids and I have ever experienced. The staff is very polite and they are always willing to help and answer questions if necessary. My daughter is getting the Invisalign and preparation went smoothly. <br>
            <br>
        It’s Very clean and every one is happy to see you and help you with a big smile. I love it!! Courtney is my hygienist and she is so awesome and helpful, I’m so happy and glad she referred me to Aj Dental Clinic, I absolutely have no worries when I come in. Thank you so much for being the best for my children and I. We really appreciate the hospitality </p>

            <h2>Patients Happiness</h2>
            <p>The service at Aj Dental Clinic was amazing: I was there for an emergency appointment regarding a wisdom tooth and the related pain. The dentist and the nurse did the routine procedure by taking x-rays and checking the teeth;<br>
                <br>
                however, they also provided cleaning of the tooth and a further check of the gum. I was esthatic that they took action immediately and went much beyond expectations both by including cleaning and gum checking and by providing a very high quality service. I have felt very comfortable and very relaxed.<br>
                <br>
                Last but not least, the staff at the reception is very friendly and competent. Covid safety procedures are well respected and enforced; hygiene conditions are of the highest possible standard.
                Overall, a wonderful experience, which relieved both my physical pain and my spirit!</p>

                <h2>Personal Review</h2>
                <p>Could not ask for a better first visit at a new dentist. The entire staff was fantastic; Emily at the front desk spoke with me several times and was able to get me in very quickly. Courtney the hygienist was phenomenal; great with communicating the process and her thoughts on my dental health, gentle during the cleaning and all around great company. <br>
                 <br>   

                Dr.Aj Parsad  Gupata. was great in the exam and discussing her plan. No products were sold to me or pitched. The only thing advised was a fluoride mouthwash that could be purchased at any store and I was given a coupon for it. Competitive pricing which I was relieved to see and zero need to seek a second opinion. I usually don’t look forward to future dental visits, but I will be happy to visit Southern Family Dental again and highly recommend them. </p>
